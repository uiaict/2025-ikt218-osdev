# Interrupt System Implementation Report

## Overview

This report describes the implementation of a basic interrupt system for the operating system, including:
- Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
- Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)
- Interrupt Requests (IRQs)
- Keyboard driver

## Implementation Details

### 1. Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)

The IDT implementation consists of:
- A structure to define IDT entries (`idt_entry`)
- A structure for the IDT pointer (`idt_ptr`)
- A function to set IDT gates (`idt_set_gate`)
- An initialization function (`idt_init`) that sets up all 256 interrupts

The IDT is loaded using the `lidt` instruction in assembly, similar to how the GDT was loaded. Each IDT entry points to the corresponding ISR handler.

### 2. Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)

ISRs are implemented for all CPU exceptions (0-31) and hardware IRQs (32-47). The implementation includes:
- Assembly stubs for each interrupt vector
- A common ISR handler that saves registers and calls the C handler
- A mechanism to register custom handlers for specific interrupts

The ISRs save the processor state, switch to kernel mode, call the C handler, and then restore the state before returning.

Each ISR is defined using a macro in assembly:
- ISR_NOERRCODE - for interrupts that don't push an error code
- ISR_ERRCODE - for interrupts that do push an error code (like page faults)

### 3. IRQ Handling

IRQ support includes:
- Remapping the PIC to move IRQs from vectors 0-15 to 32-47
- Implementing IRQ handlers for all 16 hardware interrupts
- Properly acknowledging interrupts by sending EOI signals to the PICs
- A system for registering custom IRQ handlers

IRQs are remapped to avoid conflicts with CPU exceptions. The Master PIC is remapped to use interrupts 32-39, while the Slave PIC uses 40-47. After handling an IRQ, we send the End of Interrupt (EOI) signal to the appropriate PIC.

### 4. Keyboard Driver

The keyboard driver implements:
- A handler for IRQ1 (keyboard interrupt)
- Reading scancodes from keyboard controller port 0x60
- A US QWERTY scancode-to-ASCII translation table
- A circular buffer for storing keypresses
- Functions for reading characters from the keyboard buffer

The keyboard handler reads scancodes from the keyboard port and converts them to ASCII characters. It ignores key release events (scancode with bit 7 set). Characters are displayed on the screen and stored in a circular buffer, which can be read by other parts of the OS.

## Build and Integration

The implementation was integrated into the build system using CMake. The required files are:
- IDT.h and IDT.c - For IDT setup and C-side interrupt handling
- interrupt.asm - For assembly-side interrupt handlers and IDT loading
- keyboard.h and keyboard.c - For the keyboard driver

The CMakeLists.txt was updated to include the new source files.

## Testing

The implementation was tested by:
1. Initializing the IDT
2. Triggering a software interrupt using `int $0x3`
3. Enabling the keyboard and testing character input

The test interrupt (int 0x3) confirms that the CPU exceptions are handled correctly. The keyboard test confirms that hardware interrupts are working and that the PIC remapping was successful.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. PIC Remapping: The PIC had to be remapped to avoid conflicts with CPU exceptions. This was accomplished by sending the appropriate initialization commands to the PIC chips.

2. Interrupt Handling: Created a uniform mechanism for handling both CPU exceptions and hardware interrupts. Both types of interrupts use a similar handler structure, but IRQs require additional EOI signals.

3. Keyboard Mapping: Implemented a basic US QWERTY layout for scancode translation. The mapping table only includes the most common keys and doesn't support modifiers (shift, ctrl, etc.).

4. Register Preservation: Ensuring that all registers are properly saved and restored during interrupt handling. The assembly code uses 'pusha' and 'popa' to save/restore general-purpose registers.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more complete keyboard driver with support for:
   - Shift, Caps Lock, Ctrl, and Alt modifiers
   - Function keys and special keys
   - International keyboard layouts

2. Add support for error handling in exception ISRs:
   - Detailed error messages for different exception types
   - System recovery for recoverable exceptions
   - Crash dumps for fatal exceptions

3. Implement a timer interrupt handler for IRQ0:
   - System clock/time keeping
   - Task scheduling for multitasking
   - Sleep and timeout functions

4. Add support for nested interrupts:
   - Priority-based interrupt handling
   - Interrupt masking and unmasking
   - Interrupt controller programming

5. Implement handlers for other hardware interrupts:
   - Mouse (IRQ12)
   - Serial ports (IRQ3, IRQ4)
   - Hard disk controller (IRQ14, IRQ15)
